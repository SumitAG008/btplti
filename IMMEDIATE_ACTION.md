# ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## What You See in Your Screen

You currently have **"SAP Fiori"** selected (blue radio button).

## What You Need to Change

### ❌ DON'T USE: "SAP Fiori"
- This is for **UI-only** development
- **No backend support** for CAP
- **No database tools** for HANA
- **Limited** for your requirements

### ✅ USE INSTEAD: "Full Stack Cloud Application"
- **Full backend support** with CAP
- **Database tools** for HANA Cloud
- **MTA deployment** tools
- **Everything you need** for this project

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **In the left panel**, scroll down if needed to find:
   - "Full Stack Cloud Application" (has a cloud with lightning icon)

2. **Click the radio button** next to "Full Stack Cloud Application"

3. **The right panel will update** to show "Full Stack Cloud Application Dev Space"

4. **Select these extensions** (checkboxes):
   - ✅ **CAP Tools** - Essential!
   - ✅ **MTA Tools** - For deployment
   - ✅ **SAP Fiori Tools** - For UI (optional but recommended)
   - ✅ **HTML5 Runner** - For testing

5. **Click "Create Dev Space"** button

## Why This Matters

Your application needs:
- ✅ Backend service (CAP) - **Only in "Full Stack Cloud Application"**
- ✅ Database (HANA) - **Only in "Full Stack Cloud Application"**
- ✅ SuccessFactors integration - **Requires backend**
- ✅ Budget control logic - **Requires backend**
- ✅ Approval workflows - **Requires backend**

**"SAP Fiori" alone cannot provide these!**

## After Creating Dev Space

Once created, you'll be able to:
1. Clone your repository
2. Run `cds watch` to start development
3. Build and deploy to BTP

## Quick Reference

```
Current Selection: ❌ SAP Fiori
Change To:         ✅ Full Stack Cloud Application
Extensions:        ✅ CAP Tools, MTA Tools, SAP Fiori Tools
```
